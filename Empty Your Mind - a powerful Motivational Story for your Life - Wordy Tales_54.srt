0:00:00,033 --> 0:00:04,099
Once Upon A Time In A Small Village Surrounded By Mountains

2
0:00:04,400 --> 0:00:07,999
There Lived A 24 Year Old Young Man
Named Marco.

3
0:00:08,633 --> 0:00:10,499
Marco Was Very Restless

4
0:00:11,033 --> 0:00:13,332
His Mind Was Always Full Of Thoughts

5
0:00:13,833 --> 0:00:17,299
All Day Long Different Thoughts Came And
Went

6
0:00:17,600 --> 0:00:20,799
And These Thoughts Made Him Feel Uneasy
And Tired

7
0:00:21,267 --> 0:00:25,799
He Always Felt Sad About His Past And Worried A Lot About The Future

8
0:00:26,300 --> 0:00:27,866
Because Of These Thoughts

9
0:00:27,867 --> 0:00:29,866
His Mind Was Like A Storm

10
0:00:30,267 --> 0:00:35,766
He Couldn't Feel Calm, Couldn't Sleep Well
And Even Forgot How To Smile

11
0:00:36,233 --> 0:00:40,166
One Day,, Marco Heard About A Far Away
Village In The Hillss

12
0:00:40,767 --> 0:00:43,799
One Day, Marco Heard About A Far Away
Village In The Hillss

13
0:00:44,267 --> 0:00:47,266
That Man Used To Be A Famous Psychologist In The City

14
0:00:47,867 --> 0:00:50,366
He Had Helped Many People In His Life

15
0:00:50,367 --> 0:00:53,166
And Had Taught Them How To Find Peace In
Their Minds

16
0:00:53,867 --> 0:00:54,166
4.

17
0:00:54,167 --> 0:00:55,799
Now He Was Old

18
0:00:56,633 --> 0:00:58,699
He Left The Busy Life Of The City

19
0:00:58,700 --> 0:01:00,566
And Started Living In A Quiet Village

20
0:01:00,567 --> 0:01:01,832
Close To Nature

21
0:01:02,567 --> 0:01:05,199
Sometimes He Gave Advice To Visitors

22
0:01:05,867 --> 0:01:08,132
Marco Became Curious And Hopeful

23
0:01:08,567 --> 0:01:11,366
He Decided That He Must Go And Meet That
Old Man

24
0:01:11,867 --> 0:01:16,866
He Thought.. Maybe This Wise Man Can Help
Me Find Peace

25
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:20,966
After Many Days Of A Long And Tiring
Journey

26
0:01:21,167 --> 0:01:23,466
Marco Reached The Village In The Hills

27
0:01:23,467 --> 0:01:23,766


28
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,132
When He Got There, He Saw A Small House
Covered With Greenery

29
0:01:28,133 --> 0:01:28,499
1
ل

30
0:01:28,633 --> 0:01:32,532
On The Porch Of The House The Old Man Was Sitting Quietly

31
0:01:32,533 --> 0:01:32,999


32
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,532
His Eyes Were Closed And He Looked Very
Peaceful

33
0:01:37,233 --> 0:01:39,799
Marco Walked Up To Him And Said Softly

34
0:01:39,800 --> 0:01:40,232


35
0:01:40,233 --> 0:01:43,766
Grandfather, My Mind Is Very Restless

36
0:01:44,367 --> 0:01:48,366
I Cannot Stop Thinking I Want Peace In My
Heart

37
0:01:48,600 --> 0:01:49,932
Can You Help Me?

38
0:01:50,633 --> 0:01:54,599
The Old Man Slowly Opened His Eyes And
Gave A Calm Smile

39
0:01:54,900 --> 0:01:58,499
He Said So You Are Looking For Peace

40
0:01:58,867 --> 0:02:02,332
Then Come With Me I Will Give You A Small
Task

41
0:02:02,900 --> 0:02:04,932
He Took Marco To His Little Yard

42
0:02:05,300 --> 0:02:09,399
Then He Filled A Glass With Water
Completely Full To The Top

43
0:02:09,800 --> 0:02:11,399
The Glass Was So Full

44
0:02:11,400 --> 0:02:14,332
That Even A Little Shake Would Make The
Water Spill

45
0:02:14,867 --> 0:02:17,299
He Gave The Glass To Marco And Said

46
0:02:17,900 --> 0:02:21,866
Walk From Here To The Edge Of The Village And Then Come Back
1

47
0:02:22,400 --> 0:02:26,932
But Remember You Must Not Spill Even One
Drop Of Water

48
0:02:27,900 --> 0:02:30,099
Marco Looked At Him With Surprise

49
0:02:30,500 --> 0:02:32,499
But He Wanted To Do His Best

50
0:02:32,500 --> 0:02:34,399
So He Accepted The Challenge

51
0:02:35,233 --> 0:02:38,132
He Held The Glass Carefully And Started
Walking

52
0:02:38,867 --> 0:02:40,966
The Road Was Narrow And Busy

53
0:02:41,300 --> 0:02:43,599
Some People Were Walking Some Were
n
Running
1

54
0:02:43,833 --> 0:02:47,466
Shopkeepers Were Calling Customers And
Dogs Were Barking

55
0:02:47,467 --> 0:02:48,066


56
0:02:48,067 --> 0:02:50,299
But Marco Did Not Look Around

57
0:02:50,567 --> 0:02:52,999
His Eyes Stayed Only On The Glass

58
0:02:53,800 --> 0:02:56,099
He Walked Slowly And Carefully

59
0:02:56,267 --> 0:02:57,532
Step By Step

60
0:02:58,167 --> 0:03:00,366
People Looked At Him With Surprise

61
0:03:00,400 --> 0:03:05,299
But No One Disturbed Him They Knew He Was Learning Something Important

62
0:03:05,300 --> 0:03:06,266


63
0:03:06,267 --> 0:03:09,799
Finally Marco Came Back To The Old Mar
And Said

64
0:03:10,367 --> 0:03:12,066
Grandfather I Did It

65
0:03:12,167 --> 0:03:14,532
I Didn't Spill Even One Drop Of Water

66
0:03:14,533 --> 0:03:15,032
4ŷ

67
0:03:15,033 --> 0:03:17,166

The Old Man Nodded And Smiled

68
0:03:17,667 --> 0:03:20,199
1
'?
Then He Asked That's Good

69
0:03:20,600 --> 0:03:25,066
But Tell Me Did You See The Children Playing
On The Side Of The Road

70
0:03:25,633 --> 0:03:27,399
Did You Hear The Dogs Barking

71
0:03:27,600 --> 0:03:27,866
ވ

72
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,299
Marco Looked Surprised And Said No

73
0:03:31,300 --> 0:03:31,699


74
0:03:31,767 --> 0:03:33,399
I Didn't See Or Hear Anything

75
0:03:33,400 --> 0:03:33,966


76
0:03:33,967 --> 0:03:36,099
I Was Only Focusing On The Glass

77
0:03:37,100 --> 0:03:39,699
The Old Man Smiled Again And Said Gently

78
0:03:40,367 --> 0:03:41,732
That Is The Secret

79
0:03:42,200 --> 0:03:45,466
Something That Was Always Inside You But
You Didn't Know

80
0:03:46,033 --> 0:03:48,566
When Your Mind Stays In The Present
Moment

81
0:03:48,767 --> 0:03:50,599
Then There Is No Space For Fear

82
0:03:50,600 --> 0:03:50,899


83
0:03:50,900 --> 0:03:53,932
No Confusion And No Extra Thoughts

84
0:03:54,867 --> 0:03:57,532
You Were Only Thinking About The Water In
The Glass

85
0:03:58,067 --> 0:04:01,332
At That Time Your Mind Became Completely
Quiet

86
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:03,932
You Were Not Sad About The Past

87
0:04:04,367 --> 0:04:06,266
You Were Not Afraid Of The Future

88
0:04:06,267 --> 0:04:06,899


89
0:04:07,367 --> 0:04:08,199
Slowly

90
0:04:08,200 --> 0:04:12,999
Marco Began To Understand This Was The
Peace He Was Searching For

91
0:04:13,367 --> 0:04:15,766
Peace Is Not Something We Find Outside

92
0:04:16,100 --> 0:04:20,299
Peace Is Already Inside Us When We Live In
The Present Moment

93
0:04:20,833 --> 0:04:23,199
Marco Bowed His Head And Said Softly

94
0:04:23,333 --> 0:04:23,599


95
0:04:23,767 --> 0:04:26,332
Grandfather Now I Understand

96
0:04:27,067 --> 0:04:28,866
If I Want To Calm My Mind

97
0:04:29,033 --> 0:04:31,199
I Must Keep My Mind In This Moment

98
0:04:31,633 --> 0:04:33,599
That Is When Real Peace Comes

99
0:04:34,067 --> 0:04:34,466


100
0:04:34,467 --> 0:04:36,332
The Old Man Smiled Again

101
0:04:36,333 --> 0:04:36,866


102
0:04:36,867 --> 0:04:40,799
The Sun Was Setting And The Last Light
Touched The Ground

103
0:04:41,133 --> 0:04:41,399


104
0:04:41,400 --> 0:04:43,466
Birds Were Flying Back To Their Nests

105
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,066
Marco Started Walking Back Home

106
0:04:46,300 --> 0:04:49,899
But Now He Was Not The Same Restless
Young Man

107
0:04:50,100 --> 0:04:51,466
He Had Changed

108
0:04:51,700 --> 0:04:56,332
He Was Peaceful Inside Because Now He
Knew How To Calm The Mind
